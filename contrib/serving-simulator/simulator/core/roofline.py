def roofline_analyze(bandwidth, max_OPS, OPs, memory_access):
    """
    Perform roofline performance model analysis to determine performance bottlenecks.

    The roofline model is a performance analysis tool that helps identify whether a
    computation is limited by memory bandwidth or compute capability. It plots
    performance (operations per second) against arithmetic intensity (operations per byte).

    Args:
        bandwidth (float): Memory bandwidth in bytes per second
        max_OPS (float): Maximum computational performance in operations per second (peak FLOPS)
        OPs (float): Total number of arithmetic operations performed
        memory_access (float): Total memory bytes accessed

    Returns:
        tuple: A 3-element tuple containing:
            - arithmetic_intensity (float): Operations per byte accessed (OPs/byte)
            - performance (float): Achieved performance in operations per second
            - bound (str): Performance limitation type - either "memory" or "compute"

    The function determines the performance bound by:
    1. Calculating the roofline turning point where memory and compute bounds intersect
    2. Computing the actual arithmetic intensity of the operation
    3. Determining if the operation is memory-bound or compute-bound
    4. Calculating the achievable performance based on the binding constraint
